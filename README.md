## Implementation
This game was build as a part of Electronic Arts(EA)'s Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program. It is similar to Pacman game.

The Pacman game was provided as a part of the program which you can find it here: https://github.com/hbokmann/Pacman

## Rules of the Game
<li> VaxMan can kill enemies if it comes in contact with enemies
<li> Enemies multiplies every 30 seconds
<li> The goal of the game is to collect all points before enemies grows 32 times which is 32 * 4

## Steps Involved
<li> Understood the code and how it works
<li> Created a list for each types of enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) which keeps track of all of its oject and movement
<li> Created a main list which has all the list of enemies
<li> Learned how to change some of the functions which can work with list
<li> Added the code which keeps track of time and multiplies the ghost every 30 seconds
<li> Learned how to use pygame library 
  
## Next Steps
<li> Develop more games using python and interact with diferent libraries
